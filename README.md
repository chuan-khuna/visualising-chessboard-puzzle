# Visualising the chessboard puzzle

```txt
Prisoner 1 walks in, sees a chessboard where each square has a coin on top, flipped either to heads or tails.  
The warden places the key under one of the squares, which prisoner 1 sees.  
Before he leaves, he must turn over one and only one coin.  
Prisoner 2 then walks in and is supposed to be able to figure out which squares the key is in just by looking at the arrangement of coins.
